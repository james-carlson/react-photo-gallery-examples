# React Photo Gallery
[James Carlson](https://github.com/james-carlson). If you see something wrong or that can be improved, let me know.  

## Overview
When students working on React projects want to display images in something akin to a photo gallery, the `react-photo-gallery`  (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-photo-gallery) library is pretty slick. 

The docs are pretty self-explanatory and helpful: https://github.com/neptunian/react-photo-gallery. Many students may be able to just get everything from there.  

Especially helpful are the examples here: http://neptunian.github.io/react-photo-gallery/examples/lightbox.html

Make note of this:
```
There is an example app that comes with the project. To build the examples locally clone the repo, cd into the project directory and run:

npm install
npm start
Navigate to localhost:8000 in a browser.  
```


If a students can't figure out the info from here, they probably shouldn't get points for using this in their projects.
